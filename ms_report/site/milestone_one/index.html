<p>Calorie counting is a chore. We often come across recipes which pique our
interest but do not provide the nutritional information of the resulting
dish. This might cause us to have second thoughts about giving it a go, 
especially if we have a dietary plan in mind. Sure, we could look up the
nutritional information for each ingredient ourselves, but that gets tedious
really quickly.</p>
<p>Let us do the counting so that you can do the eating!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As one trying to lose weight, it is difficult to calorie count.
   do so without having to do up a spreadsheet or a notebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one trying to lose weight, I want to know whether the food I'm about to
   eat will make me go above my daily caloric intake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one trying to lose weight, recipes frequently don't give caloric intake,
   plus other nutritional information. It is annoying to search up the
   calories of each ingredient and do the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\text{math}</span><script type="math/tex">\text{math}</script></span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<p>We want to streamline the process of counting your calories through a
well-designed website.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The core functionality of the website will be to allow users to input ingredients
in specified amounts. The website will then output the total number of calories
or calories per serving for that dish. Regarding the core functionality, some
difficulties that we expect to encounter include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-processing of nutritional information from public food databases</li>
<li>UX design</li>
<li>Handling user inputs (ingredients) that are not inside our own database</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="to-complete-by-mid-june-prototype">To complete by mid-June (Prototype)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input recipe's ingredients into the website and it will
  return the number of calories</li>
<li>Database of common foods<ul>
<li><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\frac{1}{2}\text{lb}</span><script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}\text{lb}</script></span> chicken breast</li>
<li><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">100g</span><script type="math/tex">100g</script></span> beef</li>
<li><span><span class="MathJax_Preview">1\text{ cup}</span><script type="math/tex">1\text{ cup}</script></span> rice, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decent, functional UI</li>
<li>User accounts with passwords (oAuth, Facebook, Google sign-ins)</li>
<li>Graphs that track caloric intake over a given time period</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we plan to implement SO MANY MORE features once the core
functionality is finished. These include the features in the
<a href="#extensions">Extensions</a> section of this README. The following are possibly
some other features we can implement.</p>
<h3 id="to-complete-by-mid-july-refinement">To complete by mid-July (Refinement)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sleek UI</li>
<li>Saving recipes locally and to the Cloud</li>
<li>User-recommended recipes</li>
<li>Mobile notifications for users who are counting calories</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-will-it-work">How will it work?</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> as expected, <code>HTML5</code> and <code>CSS</code></p>
<p><strong>Database:</strong> <code>SQL</code></p>
<p><strong>Webapp:</strong> Main logic implemented using <code>JavaScript</code></p>
<p><strong>User Accounts:</strong> Handled using oAuth 2.0 through Google
Firebase. This is not required to use the website, but is recommended to get
more features that we plan to implement by the Refinement stage of the project.
We will also use Facebook and Google user sign-ins.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions <a name="extensions"></a></h2>
<p>While we hope to make a website that is able to fulfill the
aim above. We hope to extend the functionality of the app after the core
idea has been implemented. So far, we wish to accommodate different
use-cases, such as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Different lifestyles such as those who to eat less and weight or to eat
   healthily, or to bulk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily caloric goal (DCG) that is input by the user (suggestions can be
   given via a lifestyle questionnaire). The app should be able
   to inform the user whether their DCG has been overrun. The user should also
   be able to determine how many meals they want to eat in a day, how much
   they want to split calories between meals, what time they want to eat, etc.
   If they do not want to provide such information, our algorithm will
   automatically generate a mealplan for them within their specified DCG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations on what food to eat for the next meal. For example, if the
   user has eaten too much meat in one meal, the program might give a recipe
   that has more vegetables or fruits in the next meal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="project-log">Project Log</h2>
<p>Our project log is documented
