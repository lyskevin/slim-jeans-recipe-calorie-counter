# Official repository for $TEAMNAME (Orbital 2019)

Slim Jeans is a website which allows users to key in a recipe's details to find out caloric information. Features such as saving recipes and plotting graphs are also included. I worked on this project together with my partner Ryan as part of NUS' Orbital 2019 summer program. Visit [this website](lyskevin.pythonanywhere.com) to find out more!
